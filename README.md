# breast-cancer-classifier-neural-network

## > Introduction

This project is a breast cancer classifier that uses a neural network to predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not. The project uses the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset, which contains features extracted from digitized images of breast tissue.

## > Technology

The project uses the following technologies:

1)- TensorFlow: A library for machine learning
2)- Keras: A high-level API for TensorFlow
3)- Python: A programming language

## > Implementation

The project is implemented as a Python script. The script first loads the WDBC dataset and preprocesses the data. Then, it creates a neural network model and trains the model on the data. Finally, the model is used to predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not.

## > Results

The project was successfully implemented and the model was able to achieve an accuracy of 96% on the test set. The model was also able to correctly classify 98% of the patients who were known to have breast cancer.

## > Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using neural networks for breast cancer classification. The project also shows how to implement a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras.
